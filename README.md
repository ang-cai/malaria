Analyzing Malaria covariate raster data in Uganda with confirmatory factor analysis at Telethon Kids Institute

"In this project we will explore statistical methods for adding survey data on health facility quality and satisfaction into this picture. The work will require the intern to become familiar with the analysis of Demographic and Health Surveys datasets and geographical (raster & vector) datasets, as well as to study and apply a confirmatory factor analysis algorithm."
