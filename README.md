# malariafitting
Work at Telethon Kids Institute on fitting malaria case data with GLMs

In this project we will explore statistical methods for adding survey data on health facility quality and satisfaction into this picture. The work will require the intern to become familiar with the analysis of Demographic and Health Surveys datasets and geographical (raster & vector) datasets in the R programming language, as well as to study and apply a confirmatory factor analysis algorithm.
